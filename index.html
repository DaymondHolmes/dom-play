            REVERSE TO REVEAL - ELLIE - cross-legged on the ground, Joel's jacket around her like a blanket, facing forward. Joel stands in the B.G. behind her. She doesn't turn around. Until she does

            <p><span data-actor=" ellie">ELLIE You want your jacket back?</span> </p>
            <p><span data-actor=" narrator">He avoids her eyes the moment she turns around. And he doesn't answer. He just sits down next to his backpack, and pulls out some beef jerky. 

                He gives a little shrug. He tosses her some. Maybe like you would to a dog. 
                <p><span data-actor=" ellie">ELLIE Okay. Fine. If that's how it is.</span> </p>
                <p><span data-actor=" narrator">She takes it and eats some. 
                
                They both chew in silence. Then:

            <p><span data-actor=" ellie">ELLIE I've never been in the woods. </span> </p>

            <p><span data-actor=" joel">JOEL I don't want your sorries.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor=" ellie">ELLIE I wasn't going to say I'm sorry. I was going to say I've been thinking about what happened. No one made you take me. No one made you or Tess go along with this plan. You needed a truck battery or whatever, and you made a choice.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor=" narrator">He looks at her. Wants to be disgusted, but sees how easily her emotions come. His eyes won't fill up. Hers do. </span> </p>
            <p><span data-actor=" ellie">ELLIE So don't blame me for something that isn't my fau</span> </p> 
            <p><span data-actor=" narrator">He starts to say something, but nothing comes. Because he has no argument for that. She's right.
            
                And she's just a kid. What's wrong with you? So after a bit, he gives her the tiniest acknowledgment. It isn't her fault.<br><br>
                Good. She wills her eyes to dry. Then:
            </span> </p> 
            <p><span data-actor=" ellie">ELLIE How much longer?</span> </p>
            <p><span data-actor=" joel">JOEL Five hour hike</span> </p>
            <p><span data-actor=" narrator">She nods. Grabs her backpack and stands up.</span> </p>
